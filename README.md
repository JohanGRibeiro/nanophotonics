# Nanophotonics metasurface engineering 
Inverse design AI work on designing metalenses, with the object of implementing, comparing and upgrading:
- Library Method
- Topology Method
- Shape Optimization Method

Benchmarking speed and compression is one of the main objectives, as well as optimizing algorithm efficiency

# Structure and how to run
- main.py : file you're supposed to run
- optics.py : file containing physics logic such as simulating EM wave response to nanopillars
- CompressionGraphs.ipynb : file containing any data analysis regarding the current state of the work
- geometricElements.py : file containing library of nanopillars and metasurface to be referenced in main.
